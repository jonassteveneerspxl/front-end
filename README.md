# Welcome to the Climapulse Front-end Developer Test!

## Repository Setup

### Create Your Own Repository

After receiving the `front-end-test.zip` file, create a new GitHub repository (private or public) and push the provided setup files to your main branch without modifications.

### Submitting Your Solution

Once your solution is complete, share the link to your repository (and provide access if necessary). Please include instructions in the `README.md` on how to run the application.

## API Setup

A mock API is provided using the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0) package, located in the `/api` folder. To start the API, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once running, you can fetch user data with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/users
```

## Go to /frontend for solution and readme

In this folder, you wil find my solution of the assignment with further setup and usage instructions in the readme.md file.

## Designs and Wireframes

**The provided designs are guidelines** and should be treated as wireframes. Pixel-perfect implementation is not required. You can find design images in the `/designs` folder, and a Figma file is available for import into your own Figma account (free accounts are supported).

## The Assignment

Your task is to build a web application with the pages described below, as if it were intended for production deployment.
Each page includes optional bonus features you may choose to implement. For these, refer to the [json-server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0?tab=readme-ov-file#routes) for available REST API options.

You are free to use any tech stack you prefer. We recommend choosing one you are most comfortable with.
